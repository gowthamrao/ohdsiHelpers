\title{Rescale data within a DataFrame based on specified methods}
\usage{
rescaleData(
  data,
  observedField,
  expectedField = NULL,
  groupBy = NULL,
  rescaleMethod = "none"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A DataFrame containing the data to be rescaled.}

\item{observedField}{The name of the column in \code{data} whose values are to be rescaled.}

\item{expectedField}{Optional; the name of the column against which rescaling calculations such as
absolute or percent changes are to be computed. Required if \code{rescaleMethod} is either "absoluteChange"
or "percentChange".}

\item{groupBy}{Optional; vector of column names in \code{data} used for grouping data before applying the
rescaling. If NULL, the entire dataset is treated as a single group.}

\item{rescaleMethod}{A character string specifying the method of rescaling to apply. Supported methods
are "none" (returns original values), "minMax" (min-max normalization), "absoluteChange" (difference from \code{expectedField}),
"percentChange" (percentage difference from \code{expectedField}), "log" (logarithmic scale transformation),
"zScore" (z-score normalization), and "robust" (robust z-score using median absolute deviation).
Default is "none".}
}
\value{
A DataFrame with the \code{observedField} rescaled according to the specified method.
}
\description{
This function applies various rescaling methods to a selected field within a data frame, optionally
grouped by one or more columns. Rescaling methods include min-max scaling, absolute change, percent change,
logarithmic transformation, z-score normalization, and robust z-score using median absolute deviation.
